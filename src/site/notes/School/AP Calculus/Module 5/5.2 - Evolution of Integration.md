## Riemann sums
- A way to approximate (and eventually obtain) an integral
	- Drawing $n$ rectangles under a curve
	- Eventually, we take the limit of these rectangles as the number of them approaches infinity and find the derivative.
## Riemann sum formula and integral notation

- Notice that the $\Delta x$ is the length of each equal partition.
- Some problems might involve going from this to integral notation: $\displaystyle\int_{a}^{b}f(x) \, dx$. Substitute $c_{k}$ for $x$ to convert between forms. 
## Some facts
- All continuous functions are integrable.
