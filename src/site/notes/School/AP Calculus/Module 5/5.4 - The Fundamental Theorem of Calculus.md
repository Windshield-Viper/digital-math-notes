The big one :D 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus relates integrals to derivatives. Here are the two parts of the theorem:
## Part 1
If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, then the function $\displaystyle F(x)=\int_{a}^xf(t) \, dt$ has a derivative at every point $x$ in $[a,b]$, and $\displaystyle \frac{dF}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}\int_{a}^xf(t) \, dt=f(x)$, where $f(x)$ or something similar is the function evaluated at the upper limit multiplied by the derivative of the upper limit. This only works if $a$ is a constant. 
### In human English
The derivative of the integral of a continuous function $f(x)$ is $f(x)$.
## Part 2 – AKA the Integral Evaluation Theorem
If $f$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, and $F$ is any antiderivative of $f$ on $[a,b]$, then $\displaystyle F(b)-F(a)=\int_{a}^bf(x) \, dx$
- This is important for evaluating integrals by hand.
## FTC FRQs
- Important to practice, cause they come in a few different forms:
	- In/out problems
	- Geometry problems (that don’t even really require the FTC)
	- Position problems - integrate acceleration to get velocity and integrate velocity to get position
- In general, remember to derive to go “down” a level and integrate to go “up” a level.
