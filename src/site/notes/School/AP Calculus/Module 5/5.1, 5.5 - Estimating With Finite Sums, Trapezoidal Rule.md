We can use rectangles and trapezoids to approximate the area under a curve.
- These are not exact estimates _yet_, but they will be soon with Riemann sums.
## LRAM, RRAM, and MRAM
- To approximate area under a curve, we can strategically place rectangles along it and take their combined area.
	- Rectangles can be placed using the left (LRAM), right (RRAM), or middle part of the top of the rectangle.  
	- Worth noting: MRAM is the average

### How do these measurements compare to actual area?
- For increasing functions:
	- LRAM underapproximates area under the curve
	- RRAM overapproximates
- For decreasing functions:
	- LRAM overapproximates
	- RRAM underapproximates
- Do out 
## Trapezoidal rule
- The same as the above, but with trapezoids!

- We find the area of a trapezoid using the formula $A=\frac{1}{2}h(b_{1}+b_{2})$.
	- Keep in mind that every trapezoid has $\frac{1}{2}h$ in common, so all we need to worry about is the bases.
- Trapezoidal rule formula: $A = \frac{1}{2}h(b_{1}+b_{n}+2(b_{2}+b_{3}+\dots))$
- If the function is concave up, the rule is an over-estimate, and vice versa.
