## Testing for continuity at a point
### Interior Points
A function $y=f(x)$ is continuous at an interior point $c$ of its domain if $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to c } = f(c)$.
### Endpoints
A function $y=f(x)$ is continuous at a left endpoint $a$ or a right endpoint $b$ of its domain if $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to a^+ } = f(a)$ or $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to b^- } = f(b)$ respectively.
### TLDR
**Step 1:** Does $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to c } f(x)$ exist? 
	(are [[School/AP Calculus/Module 2/2.1 - Intro to Limits#Whether or not a limit exists\|the left and right hand limits equal?]])
**Step 2:** Does $f(c)$ exist? 
**Step 3**: Do the limit and function value equal one another?

## Types of (dis)continuity
- Jump continuity
	- e.g. piecewise functions
- Removable discontinuity
	- i.e. a hole
- Infinite discontinuity
	- e.g. a vertical asymptote
- Oscillating discontinuity
	- e.g. $y=\sin\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)$
## Removing a discontinuity (“filling in holes”)
Essentially just cancel terms that make the denominator zero and then evaluate the function at that point.

## Extrema
- Just maximums and minimums
- You can have local and absolute extrema
#### Continuity and extrema
- If a function $y=f(x)$ is continous in $[a,b$], then $f(x)$ has both an absolute maximum and minimum on that interval.
	- We could say “$f(x)$ has a max of $6$ at $x=3$”
- In an open interval (e.g. $(1,1)$) the absolute maximum/minimum can’t be the endpoints.
