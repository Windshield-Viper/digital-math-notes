## Relating tangents and derivatives
- A derivative is an instantaneous rate of change
- A way to find the average rate of change of a curve is to find the slope of a secant of the curve (a line intersecting it at two points which we can call $Q$ and $P$)
- As $Q$ approaches $P$, the secant $\overline{PQ}$ approaches a line tangent to the curve (intersecting at one point)
- The smaller the interval, the closer the avg. rate of change is to the instantaneous rate of change
- **The slope of the tangent represents the derivative**
