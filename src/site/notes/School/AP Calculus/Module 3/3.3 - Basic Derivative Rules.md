## Derivative of a Constant Function
If $f$ is the function with constant value $c$, then $\displaystyle\frac{df}{dx}=\frac{d}{dx}(c)=0$.
- Essentially, derivative of a constant is always $0$.
## Power rule for Positive and Negative Integer Powers of $x$
If $n$ is a positive integer, then $\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}x^n=nx^{n-1}$. This works for negative integer powers too.
## Constant Multiple Rule
If $u$ is a differentiable function of $x$ and $c$ is a constant, then $\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(cu)=c\frac{du}{dx}$.
- So derivative of $3x^4$ is $3$ times the derivative of $x^4$.
## Sum and Difference Rule
If $u$ and $v$ are differentiable functions of $x$, then their sum and difference are differentiable at every point where $u$ and $v$ are differentiable. At such points, $\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(u\pm v)=\frac{du}{dx}\pm \frac{dv}{dx}$
- Basically, you can separately take derivatives of different terms of the polynomial.
## Product Rule
The product of two differentiable functions $u$ and $v$ is differentiable, and $\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(uv)=u\frac{dv}{dx}+v\frac{du}{dx}$.
- In words, (first function)(derivative of second function)+(second function)(derivative of first function).
## Quotient Rule
At a point where $v\neq 0$, the quotient $y=\frac{u}{v}$ of two differentiable functions is differentiable, and $\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{u}{v} \right)=\frac{v\frac{du}{dx}+u\frac{dv}{dx}}{v^2}$.
