Now we can take the derivative of pretty much anything.
## Derivative of $e^x$
- The derivative of $e^x$ is simply $e^x$.
### Proof:

## Derivative of any general $e^u$
$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(e^u)=e^u\left( \frac{du}{dx} \right)$
- This is the same as above – just [[School/AP Calculus/Module 3/3.6 - The Chain Rule\|chain it]] with whatever is in the exponent.
## Derivative of any general $a^u$
- We use the fact that $\displaystyle a^x=e^{\ln(a^{x})}$.
$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(a^u)=a^u\ln a\left( \frac{du}{dx} \right)$

## Derivative of $\ln x$
- Simply $\displaystyle\frac{1}{x}$.

## Derivative of any general $\ln u$
- Do the same as we did before – simply chain with the $u$ inside.
$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(\ln u)=\frac{1}{u}\left( \frac{du}{dx} \right)$
## Derivative of $\log_{a}x$
- The derivative of $\log_{a}x$ is $\displaystyle\frac{1}{x\ln a}$.
### Proof

## Any general $\log_{a}u$
- More chaining.
$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}(\log_{a}u)=\frac{1}{u\ln a}\left( \frac{du}{dx} \right)$
## Logarithmic differentiation
- Nothing major – just keep in mind that to differentiate certain equations, you may need to take the $\ln$ of both sides.
### Example
Turn the equation $y=x^x$ into $\ln y=x\ln x$ before differentiating.
