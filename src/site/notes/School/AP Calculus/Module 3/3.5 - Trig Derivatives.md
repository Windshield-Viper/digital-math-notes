## The derivatives
$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\sin x=\cos x$

$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\cos  x=-\sin x$

$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\tan x=\sec^2 x$

$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\cot x=-\csc^2 x$

$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\sec x=\sec x\tan x$

$\displaystyle\frac{d}{dx}\csc x=-\csc x \cot x$

- Some proofs can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FCGsi6mHk0&list=PLBSRjc5Bh-86nd7GlzzJS0KuToFiem6s2&index=12).
	- To derive the others, use things like the product and quotient rules, the quotient trig identities, and already-found identities.
## Periodicity
- Sine and cosine derivatives are periodic – this means that they repeat every certain number of powers.
	- The first and fifth derivatives are the same, the second and sixth, etc…  
$f(x)=\sin x$  
$f'(x)=\cos x$  
$f''(x)=-\sin x$  
$f'''(x)=-\cos x$  
$f''''(x)=\sin x$  
$f'''''(x)=\cos x$
## Pythagorean Identities
(These aren’t really covered but are important to know anyway.)

$\sin^2x+\cos^2x=1$

$\tan^2x+1=\sec^2x$

$\csc^2x+1=\cot^2x$
