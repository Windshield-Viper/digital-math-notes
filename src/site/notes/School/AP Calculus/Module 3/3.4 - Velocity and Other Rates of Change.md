## Motion along a straight line
## Velocity
- This is *implied instantaneous velocity*.
- The first derivative of the position function is the velocity function – $s(t)$ is $s'(t)=v(t)$.
- The particle stops when $v=0$.
### Average velocity
- This is displacement/travel time.
## Acceleration
- This is *implied instantaneous acceleration*.
- It’s the second derivation of the position function, or the first derivative of velocity – $s''(t)=v'(t)=a(t)$.
### Average acceleration
- Equal to $\frac{\nabla v}{\nabla t}$ or change in velocity/change in time.
## Speed
- This is just the absolute value of velocity.
## Displacement
- Displacement is the change in position (final position - starting position).
