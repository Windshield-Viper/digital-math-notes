A process that allows you to take the derivative of multi-variable functions.
- Itâ€™s basically just the chain rule, but you have to keep in mind that the derivative of $y$ with respect to $x$ is simply $\frac{dy}{dx}$ .
## Example
*What is the derivative of $3y^2$ with respect to $x$?*
- Use the [[School/AP Calculus/Module 3/3.6 - The Chain Rule\|chain rule]] - derivative of outside @ inside * derivative of inside. This becomes $6y^{1} * \frac{dy}{dx}$.
## Second Example
*Find the derivative of $x^2+y^2=4$*
- This becomes $2x + 2y* \frac{dy}{dx} = 0$.
- Solving for $\frac{dy}{dx}$ gives us that $\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{x}{y}$.
## Third Example
*What is the derivative of $x^2-xy+y^2=7$?*
- This turns into $2x-\left( x* \frac{dy}{dx} + y*1 \right)+2y * \frac{dy}{dx}=0$
	- We used the sum rule, the product rule, and the chain rule.
- Eventually we get that $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{-2x+y}{-x+2y}$.
