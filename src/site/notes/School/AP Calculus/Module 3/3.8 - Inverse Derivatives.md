## Inverse basics
- The slope of an inverse function is the **reciprocal** of the slope of the original.
	- NOT the negative reciprocal.
- Also keep in mind that the inputs and outputs to the function switch as well, as do the domain and range.
## Shaq chart (aka marley map??)
- Used to calculate slopes of inverse functions.

| x      | point | slope |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| $f(x)$ |       |       |
| $f^{-1}$       |       |       |
- Fill this in when doing derivatives.
## Inverse Trig Derivatives
- The derivative of arcsin x is $\displaystyle d/dx(\arcsin x) = 1/\sqrt{ 1-x² }$, when $-1 < x < 1$
- The derivative of arccos x is $\displaystyle d/dx(\arccos x) = -1/\sqrt{1-x²  }$, when $-1 < x < 1$
- The derivative of arctan x is $\displaystyle d/dx(\arctan x) = 1/(1+x²)$, for all $x$ in $R$
- The derivative of arccsc x is $\displaystyle d/dx(csc^{-1} x) = -1/(|x|\sqrt{x²-1  })$, when $x < -1$ or $x > 1$
- The derivative of arcsec x is $\displaystyle d/dx(sec^{-1} x) = 1/(|x|\sqrt{x²-1  }$), when $x < -1$ or $x > 1$
- The derivative of arccot x is $\displaystyle d/dx(cot^{-1} x) = -1/(1+x²)$, for all $x$ in $R$
## Using right triangles to find inverse derivatives
- You don’t have to memorize the above if you use **right triangles** to find the derivatives instead.
### Example
*Find the derivative of $y=\arccos\left( \frac{2x}{5} \right)$.*
1. Take the cosine of both sides: $\cos y=\frac{2x}{5}$
2. We begin taking a derivative: $\displaystyle-\sin y \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{2}{5}$
3. Solve for $\frac{dy}{dx}$: $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{2}{-5\sin y}$
4. We need to find $\sin y$. We draw a right triangle, filling in a non-right angle as $y$, its adjacent side as $2x$, and the hypotenuse as $5$. We use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the opposite side in terms of $x$: $\sqrt{25-4x^2 }$
5. Now we can find $\sin y$ by doing opposite/hypotenuse: $\sin y=\frac{\sqrt{25-4x^2 }}{5}$
6. Plug in $\sin y$. $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{2}{\sqrt{ 25-4x^2 }}$
