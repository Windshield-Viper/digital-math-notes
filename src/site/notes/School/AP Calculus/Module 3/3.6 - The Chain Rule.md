## Layers
- The first thing needed to understand the chain rule is the concept of **layers**. A function has more than one layer if it’s composed of more than one other function:
	- For example, $2x^2$ has only one layer. 
	- $3\sin^3(4x)$ has 3 layers – $3x^3$, $\sin x$, and $4x$. First we do $4$ times some quantity $x$. We then take the $\sin$ of the result. Finally, we cube and multiple by $3$. It took us 3 steps to create this function, so there are 3 layers.
## Definition of the chain rule
If $f$ is differentiable at the point $u=g(x)$, and $g$ is differentiable at  
$x$, then the composite function $(f\circ g)(x)= f(g(x))$ is differentiable at $x$, and $(f\circ g)'(x)=f'(g(x))\cdot g'(x)$.
- So basically, the derivative of the whole thing = *derivative of outside(inside)* * *derivative of inside*. This is why it’s called the **inside-outside** rule.
## Derivative simplification rules
For when to simplify derivatives.
1. No negative exponents
2. No fractions within fractions
3. Combine all like terms
## Basic example
If $a(x)= \tan^2(x)$, then $f(x)$ is $x^2$ and $g(x)$ is $\tan x$. $a'(x)=2(\tan x)\cdot \sec^2x$, which simplifies to $\displaystyle\frac{2\sin x}{\cos^3x}$.
## Chain rule using Leibniz notation
If $y=f(u)$ and $u=g(x)$, then $\displaystyle \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}$ where $\frac{dy}{du}$ is evaluated at $u=g(x)$.
