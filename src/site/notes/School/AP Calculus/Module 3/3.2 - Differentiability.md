## Definition
A function $y=f(x)$ is differentiable on a closed interval $[a,b]$ if it has a derivative at every interior point of the interval and if the limits $\displaystyle\lim_{ h \to 0^{+}} \frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$ (the **right-hand limit**) and $\displaystyle\lim_{ h \to 0^{-}} \frac{f(b+h)-f(b)}{h}$ (the **left-handed limit**) are equal.
### What does it really mean
- You can think of it like being “locally linear” – if you zoom in on the curve, will it look like a line?
- Basically, all changes in slope should take place gradually (like a quadratic curve) and not instantly (like an absolute value curve).

## Types of non-differentiability
- Corners: one sided derivatives differ, $f(x)=|x|$
- Cusps: slopes of secants go to different infinities, $f(x) = x^{2/3}$
- Vertical tangent: slopes of secant lines approach similar infinities, $f(x)=x^{1/3}$

## Taking a derivative on a calculator
Just check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yMOknc82uw&list=PLBSRjc5Bh-86nd7GlzzJS0KuToFiem6s2&index=4).
- The main idea is that calculators are wrong when they try to calculate derivatives where they don’t exist.
