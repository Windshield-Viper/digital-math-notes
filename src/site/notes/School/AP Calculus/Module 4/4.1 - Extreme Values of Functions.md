## What are absolute extrema?
If $f$ is a function with domain $D$, then $f(c)$ is the **absolute maximum value** on $D$ if and only if $f(x)\leq f(c)$ for all $x$ in $D$.
- Essentially, the absolute maximum value is only an absolute maximum if it’s bigger than everything else.  
If $f$ is a function with domain $D$, then $f(c)$ is the **absolute minimum value** on $D$ if and only if $f(x)\geq f(c)$ for all $x$ in $D$.
- Same thing but the opposite way for the absolute minimum value.

## What are local extrema?
The same as above, but in some interval.
- Keep in mind that absolute extrema also count as local extrema.

## Key info
- Extreme values can occur at critical points OR endpoints.
- Using a sign chart on a derivative is essential, because a function’s derivative does not always change sign at critical points.
