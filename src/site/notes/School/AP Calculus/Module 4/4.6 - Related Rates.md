Essentially the same as [[School/AP Calculus/Module 4/4.4 - Optimization\|4.4 - Optimization]], but this time, there are two rates, and so now you have to do [[School/AP Calculus/Module 3/3.7 - Implicit Differentiation\|Implicit Differentiation]].
## What is a related rate?
Rates that are related. For example, the surface area and volume of a sphere, or the brightness and distance away from a star.

- Essentially, what $\frac{d?}{dt}$ do we already know, and what $\frac{d?}{dt}$ do we need?
## Example problem
### Life of Pi
A boat is pulled toward a dock by a rope from the bow using a tool that is $6$ feet above the bow. If the rope is pulled in at $2$ ft/sec, how fact is the boat approaching the dock when $10$ feet of rope are out?

We use the Pythagorean theorem to develop our model: we need to relate $x$ and $r$, and we can say that $x^2+36=r^2$. We then take the derivative of this formula using implicit diff, getting $2x \frac{dx}{dt}+0=2r \frac{dr}{dt}$. We know that $x$ and $r$ are values of a right triangle, so we know that $x=8$ and $r=10$. Given that we also know $\frac{dr}{dt}$, we finally solve our equation for $\frac{dx}{dt}$, getting that $\frac{dx}{dt}=2.5$ ft/sec.
