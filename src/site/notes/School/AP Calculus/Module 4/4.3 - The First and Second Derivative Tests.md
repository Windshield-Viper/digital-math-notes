## The first derivative test
The first derivative test has already been covered in this unit – see [[School/AP Calculus/Module 4/4.1 - Extreme Values of Functions\|4.1 - Extreme Values of Functions]].
- Essentially, the zeroes and undefined points of the first derivative of a function are critical points, and by using a sign chart it’s possible to see whether the point is a min, a max, or neither.
- The reason why this is important is that it provides easy justification for a lot of FRQs.
## The second derivative test
- We can see that a function $f(x)$ is concave up if $f''(x)$ is positive and concave down if $f''(x)$ is negative.
	- This means that the points of inflection (where the change in concavity occurs) are at the zeroes of the second derivative.
### Testing for local extrema (actual statement of the test)
*The second derivative test for local extrema states that:*
1. If $f'(c)=0$ and $f''(c)<0$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $x=c$.
2. f $f'(c)=0$ and $f''(c)>0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $x=c$.

At points where the first derivative is not defined, you cannot use the second derivative test.
