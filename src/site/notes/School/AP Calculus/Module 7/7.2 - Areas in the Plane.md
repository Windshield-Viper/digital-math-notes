Using integrals to find weird areas bounded by 2 or more functions. We can use a vertical or horizontal approach to do this.
- Use vertical when:
	- Formulas easier to keep in y = form
	- Clear which function is on top/on bottom
- Use horizontal when:
	- Formulas easier to keep in x = form
	- Clear which function is on right/left
- Answers will be the exact same regardless of what was done
Sometimes more than the difference of two integrals will be needed – this happens when the “top” and “bottom” functions switch places.
