When an area is rotated around something.
- Volume is the integral of area, so if we can find the area of a cross-section of any object and how it changes, we can find its volume.
- Think about whether the area is a disk or a washer and use the circle area formula ($A=\pi r^2$) to find areas and integrate them.
Notes for this are hard to take on a laptop. [Video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycfpaWR5om0&feature=youtu.be).

There are two types of “slice” that you can take out of a rotated area in the plane:
- A disk, with area $A=\pi r^2$
- A washer, with area $A=\pi(R^2-r^2)$
Integrating these areas gives you the volume of the total rotated area.
