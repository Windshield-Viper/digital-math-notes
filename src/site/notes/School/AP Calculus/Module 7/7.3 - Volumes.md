When an area is rotated around something.
- Volume is the integral of area, so if we can find the area of a cross-section of any object and how it changes, we can find its volume.
- Think about whether the area is a disk or a washer and use the circle area formula ($A=\pi r^2$) to find areas and integrate them.
