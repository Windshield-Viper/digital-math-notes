#calc/theorem 
A function $y=f(x)$ that is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ takes on every value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. In other words, if $y_{0}$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then $y_{0}=f(c)$ for some $c$ in $[a,b]$. 

## Stated basically
If we know that a function is continuous on an interval, we know that it passes through every single value between any two points we choose on its graph.
- This theorem is often helpful for proving that solutions exist on a given interval, and can be used in that way when you can prove the function changes from negative to positive within that interval.

## Structuring an answer using the IVT
Using the IVT on a problem involves using lots of words to structure an answer.
### Example 1
**Q**: Does a zero of $f(x) = x^2-4$ exist on the interval $[0,3]$?
**A**: Since $f(x) = x^2-4$ is continuous on the given interval, the IVT applies. Because $f(0)=-4$ and $f(3)=5$, the IVT proves that $f(x)=0$ at some point on $[0,3]$.
### Example 2
**Q**: Show that $f(x)=x^3+x-6$ has a solution.
**A**: Since $f(x)=x^3+x-6$ is continous on its entire domain, and $f(x)$ changes from negative to positive from $[0,10]$ , $f(x)$ must have a solution on $[0, 10]$.
