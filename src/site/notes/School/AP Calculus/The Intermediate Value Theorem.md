A function $y=f(x)$ that is continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$ takes on every value between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. In other words, if $y_{0}$ is between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then $y_{0}=f(c)$ for some $c$ in $[a,b]$. 

## Stated basically
If we know that a function is continuous on an interval, we know that it passes through every single value between any two points we choose on its graph.
- This theorem is often helpful for proving that solutions exist on a given interval, and can be used in that way when you can prove the function changes from negative to positive within that interval.
