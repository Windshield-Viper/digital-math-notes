#calc/theorem 
If $a$ and $b$ are any two points in an interval  on which $f$ is differentiable, then $f'$ takes on every value between $f'(a)$ and $f'(b)$.
## Stated basically
Take two points $a$ and $b$ on a function $f$ that have nothing weird between them (stuff that can be found [[School/AP Calculus/Module 3/3.2 - Differentiability#Types of non-differentiability\|here]]). The derivative of $f$ in that range will take on all values between the derivative of $a$ and the derivative of $b$.
