- Basically, visualizing antiderivatives of a given function by visualizing them at several key points (connects to the [[School/AP Calculus/Module 6/6.2 - Antidifferentiation by Subsitution\|next section]]; we are drawing the indefinite integral).
- To draw a slope field, just draw slope of the function at all given points.
A slope field is hard to visualize without a picture; [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLw98gvdaRI&feature=youtu.be) is the video with visuals.
