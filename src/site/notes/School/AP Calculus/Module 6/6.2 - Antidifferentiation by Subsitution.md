## Indefinite Integral
The **indefinite integral** is the family of all antiderivatives of a function $f(x)$, denoted by $\int(x) \,dx$. If $F(x)$ is an antiderivative of $f$, then $\int(x) \,dx=F(x)+C$ where $C$ is the constant of integration.
- A definite integral (what we have seen up to this point) is bounded, and so itâ€™s a number. 
- An indefinite integral is a family of functions that all have the same derivative.
