#calc/theorem  
If $g(x) \leq f(x) \leq h(x)$ for all $x \neq c$ in some interval about $c$, and $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = \lim_{x \to c} h(x) = L$, then $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to c} f(x) =L$.
- Basically, all this is saying is that if two functions sandwich a third function, and they touch/almost touch at a point, then the sandwiched function, being “squished” between the two functions, also has to be at that point.
