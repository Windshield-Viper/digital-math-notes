## Law of Exponential Change
If $y$ changes at a rate proportional to the amount present ($\frac{dy}{dt}=ky$), then $y=y_{0}e^{kt}$ where $y_{0}$ is the initial amount present and $k$ is the growth/decay constant. 
- Essentially, what this means is that in an exponential growth problem, if you see $\pm e^c$, replace it with $A$.
- If you see the statement “the rate of change is proportional to the amount present”, then know that $\frac{dy}{dt}=ky$.
## Exponential Growth/Decay Formulas
### Investment Formula
$A=p\left( 1+\frac{r}{n} \right)^{nt}$
p is amount you invest, r is annual interest rate, n is amount of times money is compounded a year, and t is time. You can do half-life with this as well.
### Continuous Compounding
$A=pe^{rt}$
