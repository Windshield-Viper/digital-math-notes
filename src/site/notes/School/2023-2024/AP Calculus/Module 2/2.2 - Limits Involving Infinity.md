- All [[School/2023-2024/AP Calculus/Properties of Limits\|Properties of Limits]] apply to limits approaching $\pm \infty$ as does [[School/2023-2024/AP Calculus/The Sandwich Theorem\|The Sandwich Theorem]].
## Asymptotes
In the graph of the function $y=f(x)$:
- $y=b$ is a *horizontal asymptote* if either:
	- $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = b$
	- $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x) = b$
- $x=a$ is a *vertical asymptote* if either:
	- $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a^{+}} f(x) = \pm \infty$
	- $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to a^{-}} f(x) = \pm \infty$
## End behavior models
- Small parts of the function become insignificant as inputs to it increase in size.
- So end behavior models (EBMs) are calculated using the leading terms of the numeration and denominator
	- example: EBM of $\frac{2x^5+x^4-x^2+1}{3x^2-5x+7}$ is simply $\frac{2x^5}{3x^2}$ or $\frac{2x^3}{3}$.
## Formal definition of an end behavior model
The function $g$ is a…
- *right-hand* EBM for $f$ if and only if $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =1$
- *left-hand* EBM for $f$ if and only if $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to -\infty} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} =1$
Intuitively, this makes sense, because what this is really saying is that $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ need to be the same as you keep “zooming out” the graph.
