## Definition of a limit
- *The value that a function approaches as the input approaches some value.*
- A **limit** is different to a **function value**.
	- **Limits**: all about approaching a value
		- $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2} f(x) = 5$
			- Pronounced “the limit as x approaches 2 of $f(x)$ is 5”
	- **Function values**: are evaluated at a point
		- $f(x) = 2$
	- Partial limits show what side a limit comes from.
		- $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 5$ comes from the left
		- $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = 5$ comes from the right
		- Partial limits always exist.
## Whether or not a limit exists
- For a limit to exist at $x$, the limit from the left side must equal the limit from the right side.
	- In algebraic terms, the $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to c^- } f(x)$ must equal $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to c^+ } f(x)$.
	- Otherwise the limit does not exist (*DNE*)
		- Use *DNE* when the right and left hand limits are not equal to each other. This includes things like vertical asymptotes for things like rational functions.
		- Very rarely, use *no limit* for things that don’t even have a right/left hand limit.
Example of a limit not existing: $\displaystyle\lim_{ x \to 0 } \frac{1}{x}$

## Finding limits algebraically
Strategies:
1. **Direct substitution:** just plug the limit into the function. Sometimes this doesn’t work because you get $0/0$.
2. **Other strategies**: 
	1. Factoring
	2. Expanding
	3. Rationalizing
	4. Finding a common denominator
	5. Multiplying by a conjugate
3. The big guns - [[School/2023-2024/AP Calculus/L'Hopital's Rule\|L'Hopital's Rule]]
## Limit of $\sin(x) /x$
An important fact that gets used a lot in these types of problems is the fact that $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin(ax)}{ax} = 1$ (where $a$ can be any non-zero constant). 
- This can be used in a variety of creative ways.
## Average and instantaneous rates of change
- Average rates of change don’t require limits. They are just slope, and slope is calculated with two points.
- Instantaneous rates of change do, because you just have one point to work with.
### Example
*An object dropped from rest from the top of a tall building falls $y=16t^2$ in the first $t$ seconds. Find the speed of the object at $t=4$ seconds.*  
**Solution**: Try using the points $4$ and $4 + h$, where $h$ is an infinitesimally small number. 
- when $t=4$, $f(x) = 256$
- when $t=4+h$, $f(x) = 16(4+h)^2$  
Now calculate the slope using these two points, using the limit as h goes to 0: $\displaystyle\lim_{h \to 0} \frac{16(4+h)^2-256}{4+h-4}$  
Solve this and eventually plug in $h$ (after cancelling the $h$ on the bottom) for a final answer of **128 ft/sec**.
