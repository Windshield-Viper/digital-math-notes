#calc/theorem 
## Increasing and decreasing functions
- A function is **increasing** on an interval if $f(x_{1})<f(x_{2})$ for points $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ in $l$.
	- If the opposite, then the function is **decreasing**.
From this we can easily see that a function increases on an interval if the derivative at every point in that interval is positive, and that a function decreases if the opposite is true.
## The mean value theorem
If a function $y=f(x)$ is continuous at every point in the closed interval $[a,b]$, then there is *at least* one point $c$ in that interval such that $\displaystyle f'(c)= \frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.

The theorem essentially just states that the average rate of change in the interval will equal the instantaneous rate of change at some point (or more than one).
## Antiderivatives
Antiderivatives are like the reverse of taking a derivative.
- You can do them with some logic: if we see that the derivative of a function has a term of $3x$, then we know that the original function came in the form $\displaystyle \frac{3}{2}x^2+c$ for some constant $c$.
