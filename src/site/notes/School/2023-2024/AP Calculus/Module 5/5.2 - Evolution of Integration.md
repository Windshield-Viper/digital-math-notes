## Riemann sums
- A way to approximate (and eventually obtain) an integral
	- Using techniques like [[School/2023-2024/AP Calculus/Module 5/5.1, 5.5 - Estimating With Finite Sums, Trapezoidal Rule\|LRAM, MRAM, RRAM, and the Trapezoidal Rule]], we can estimate integrals
	- As we create more and more partitions, we can estimate integrals even better
	- Eventually, we will be drawing infinitesimally small integrals and getting an exact area
- Taking a Riemann sum involves drawing $n$ rectangles under a curve
	- Eventually, we take the limit of these rectangles as the number of them ($n$) approaches infinity and find their combined area.
## Riemann sum formula and integral notation

- Notice that the $\Delta x$ is the length of each equal partition.
- Some problems might involve going from this to integral notation: $\displaystyle\int_{a}^{b}f(x) \, dx$. Substitute $c_{k}$ for $x$ to convert between forms. 
## Some facts
- All [[School/2023-2024/AP Calculus/Module 2/2.3 - Continuity\|continuous]] functions are **integrable** (able to be integrated).
