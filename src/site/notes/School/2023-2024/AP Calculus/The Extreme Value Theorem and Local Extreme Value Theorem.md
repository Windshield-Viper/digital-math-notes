#calc/theorem 

Very similar to the [[School/2023-2024/AP Calculus/The Intermediate Value Theorem\|Intermediate Value Theorem]].
## Extreme value theorem
If $f$ is *continuous* on a *closed interval $[a,b]$*, then $f$ has both a maximum and minimum value on the interval.

Very simple.
## Local extreme value theorem
If a function $f$ has a local maximum value or a local minimum value at an interior point $c$ of its domain, and if $f'$ exists at $c$, then $f'(c)=0$.
- If thereâ€™s a local minimum or maximum, then the rate of change will be $0$ at that point.
